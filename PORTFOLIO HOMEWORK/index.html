  <h3>UX/UI Designer</h3>
  
  <p>Hello, I am Mark Iskra, a UX/UI Designer. I have a passion for all things creative.<br> 
    I am always seeking knowledge and new ways to improve myself and surround myself with<br> 
    creative influences to learn and evolve as a designer.<br> 
    Collaboration is vital within my professional approach to work. Building a strong team<br> 
    culture allows creative work to flourish and nurture strong workplace relationship.<br>
    I enjoy fast passed environments, have excellent communication skills and thrive as<br> 
    a problem solver. Multi-skilled in many aspects of design with a keen eye for detail<br> 
    and trend-based processes.</p>
